## Problem Description:

The task at hand is to model and build a relational database for the general workings of a collegiate athletics program focused on its team roster and operations. The centeral entity in the model is the Players entity because it is the individual athletes whose information connects practices, positions, academics, equipment, injuries, awards, statistics, and NIL activity.


## Data Model Description: 

<img width="1782" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61e60e18-b439-4af2-a773-7371879c7275" />

Our model is based on the structure of an athletics roster database. The Players entity stores each athlete (with attributes such as playerName and physical measures), and it is the hub for the rest of the system. Players has a many-to-one relationship with primaryPosition, where a position records data like positionID, positionType, and the number of players at that position. Players reference their primaryPosition, so each position can have many players assigned to it.

There is a role relationship in the position area as well. primaryPosition includes captainID and captainName, and it connects to players through a labeled “Captain” relationship to indicate that a position designates a specific player as captain. Inside Players there is also a recursive “Mentor” relationship through mentorID, showing that one player can serve as a mentor for other players.

Academic information is modeled by the academic_record table. Each players record can have an associated academic_record capturing items such as GPA, creditHours, expectedGraduationDate, and probationStatus. This produces a one-to-many relationship from Players to Academic_Record so that academic snapshots can be stored per player as needed.

Player performance is captured in two places tied back to players. First, the stats table stores seasonal performance metrics (playerRating, season, gamesPlayed, snapsPlayed) and relates to players in a one-to-many fashion so multiple stat lines can exist per athlete. Second, practice participation is handled through an associative entity. Because a player can attend many practices and each practice contains many players, we created practice_attendance between practice and players. Practice holds the practiceType, practiceDate, practiceLocation, and practiceDuration, while practice_attendance tracks items such as performanceGrade, timeSpent, fullParticipant, and playsCompleted.

Health data is split between a catalog of injuries and a player-specific history. Injury lists injury types and attributes such as injurySeverity, injuryTreatmentLocation, and bodyPart. injury_history is the associative entity between players and injury and adds event details like InjuryDate, InjuryTime, and expectedRecoveryTime. This allows the database to represent many injuries per player and many players experiencing the same injury type.

Equipment issued to players in the equipment table. Each record includes equipmentType, equipmentSize, equipmentCondition, lastInspectionDate, purchaseDate, and warrantyExpirationDate and is linked to players, giving a one-to-many relationship from players to equipment so that multiple pieces of equipment can be managed per athlete.

Awards granted to players are modeled with a standard many-to-many pattern. Award stores award attributes such as awardName, awardSponsor, and trophyType. Because a player can receive many awards and an award can be conferred to many players over time, we created the conferment associative entity between award and players. Conferment records details like ConfermentDate and provides a unique ConfermentID to identify each award event.

Finally, NIL activity is represented by two tables that connect sponsors and players. NIL_sponsor contains sponsor information (sponsorName, fundNetWorth, address, city, state, industry). NIL_contract serves as the associative entity between players and nil_sponsor, capturing contractName, contractSponsor, contractType, contractValue, contractDuration, contractAwardedDate, and contractEndDate. This structure supports many contracts per player and many contracts per sponsor, with each contract clearly tied to both a specific player and a specific sponsor.

Overall, the players entity anchors the database. From it branch many-to-one relationships to primary position, academics, statistics, equipment, and injury history; many-to-many relationships are resolved through associative entities for practice attendance, award conferment, and NIL contracts; and recursive relationships handle mentors and position captains. This design cleanly captures the roster, activities, and records shown in the data model.
